# Ising Model
Ising model is a mathematical model to used to understant Ferromagnetism an its phase transition to paramagnetic behavior above critical temperature. This model consists 
of a N  fixed lattice sites arranged to form a n(n=1,2,3) dimensional array. Each of the lattice sites has a spin $S_i$ associated with it, which can take values +1 or -1.
The entire configuration of spin { $S_i$ } can be used to determine the energy of the system which is given by the hamiltonian:
